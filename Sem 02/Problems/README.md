<h3>Objectives</h3>

**Task 1:** Write a program that prints in words which day of the week it is.

*Input: 1, Output: Monday*

*Input: 5, Output: Friday*

*Input: 250, Output: Invalid day!*

**Problem 2 (Between 100 and 200):** Write a program that enters an integer and checks if it is below 100, between
100 and 200 or above 200. Print messages accordingly as in the examples below:

*Input: 95, Output: Less than 100*

*Input: 120, Output: Between 100 and 200*

*Input: 250, Output: Greater than 200*

**Problem 3 (Speed trap):** Write a program that enters a speed (decimal number) and prints
speed information. For speeds up to and including 10, print "slow". At
speed above 10 and up to 50, print "average". For speeds over 50 and up to 150, print
"fast". At speeds above 150 and up to 1000 print "ultra fast". At higher speeds
print "extremely fast"

*Input: 8, Output: slow*

*Input: 49.5, Output: average*

*Input: 126, Output: fast*

*Input: 3500, Output: extremely fast*

**Problem 4 (Figure face):** Write a program that inputs the dimensions of a geometric figure and computes
its face. There are four types of shapes: square (s), rectangle (r), circle (c) and triangle
(triangle). The first line of input reads the type of shape (square, rectangle, circle or
triangle). If the shape is a square, the next line reads one number - the length of the
side. If the shape is a rectangle, the next two lines read two numbers -
the lengths of its sides. If the figure is a circle, the next line reads one number -
the radius of the circle. If the figure is a triangle, the next two lines read two numbers
- the length of its side and the length of the height to it. The result to
round to 3 digits after the decimal point

*Input: s 5 , Output: 25*

*Input: r 7 2.5 , Output: 17.5*

*Input: c 6 , Output: 113.097*

**Problem 5 (Time + 15 minutes) :** 
Write a program that enters the hour and minutes of a 24-hour day and calculates
what the hour will be in 15 minutes. Print the result in hh:mm format.
The hours are always between 0 and 23, and the minutes are always between 0 and 59.
The hours and minutes are always written in two digits, with a leading
zero where necessary

*In: 1 46, Out: 02:01*

*Input: 0 1, Output: 00:16*

*Input: 23 59, Output: 00:14*


**Task 6 :** 
We will say that a sequence of numbers is a saw if each number in it is both greater than or equal to its two neighbors, or both less than or equal to them.
For the first and last elements, we have only one neighbor each. 
Write a program that inputs from the standard 5's number of integers. To output
to the standard output "yes" if the sequence entered is sawtooth, or "no" otherwise
Otherwise.

*Input: 1 5 1 0 3 , Output: no*

*Input: -10 10 -2 11 -22 , Output: yes*


**Problem 7 :** 
Write a program that, given a radius r and a two-dimensional point (x, y), checks whether the point is inside/outside or on the contour of a circle centered at (0,0).

*Input: 5 0 5, Output: On the circle*

*Input: 5 10 30, Output: Out of the circle*

*Input: 5 0 2, Output: In the circle*
